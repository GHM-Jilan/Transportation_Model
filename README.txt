Project Name: 
============
Developing a Transportation Model based on Linear Programming & solve the model by applying Python Programming Language


Problem Statement: 
=================
Wireless Widget (WW) Company has six warehouses supplying to eight vendors with their widgets. Each warehouse has a capacity of widgets that cannot be exceeded, and each vendor has a demand for widgets that must be satisfied. The objective is to determine how many widgets to ship from each warehouse to each vendor so as to minimize the total shipping cost. 


Requisite of this Project:
=========================
This project will assist the industries to find the optimal route and volume of transportation of their products or raw materials, which ultimately minimize the Transportation Cost. 


Project Overview: 
================
A Transportation Model is a mathematical model that represents the relationship of the allocation of resources from a set of sources to a set of destinations. The aim of the model is to find the optimal route and volume of transportation, i.e., minimizing the total shipping cost. In this project- a Transportation Model based on Linear Programming was developed & the model was solved in Python environment. 


Project Completion Steps:
========================
1. Gathering Relevant Data
2. Formulation of Mathematical Model
3. Solving the model by implementing Python Programming Language
	- Importing Necessary Libraries
	- Defining the Model
	- Listing the value of different parameters
	- Defining the Decision Variables
	- Formulating & Adding the Objective Function into the Model
	- Formulating the Constraints and Adding them into the model
	- Creating the model solver
	- Results
		Finding Optimum value of the objective functon
		Finding Optimum values of the decision variables
4. Findings
	- Optimum Routes & Volume 	
	- Visualizing the Optimum Routes
	- Visualizing the percentage of Transportation Volume through different routes
